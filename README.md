Images to Pencil Sketch

The project takes an input image and outputs its pencil sketch form.

It uses a simple approach where the input is converted to balck and white, inverted, taken its gaussian blur, and then again inverted to give the final output.

The inverting and blurring steps provide the paper and shadow layers necessary for the pencil sketch effect.�
